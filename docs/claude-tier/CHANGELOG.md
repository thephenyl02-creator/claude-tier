# Claude Tier changelog

Each entry is an installable GitHub release of the `tier` plugin. Development between releases lives in the commit log. The rule block tag (`tier-rule vX.Y.Z`) and the release version are independent: a docs-only release does not bump the tag.

- **1.10.0** - The measured rule, audited. Four sweep rounds (125 graded
  agent runs over eight task shapes, every grader validated against a
  baseline and a reference first) settled model-versus-effort: **model is the
  strong lever, effort the weak one.** Opus at low held the one edge case
  Sonnet failed at low, medium and high; a 19-test hard build came back
  perfect from every cell, so a low pin degrades on ambiguity, not
  difficulty - hence the `ESCALATE:` hatch (a pinned-low agent that meets
  more than its brief hands the task back for a one-tier-up re-run). `max`
  is never a default: 2-5x the cost of low for no correctness gain. An
  independent adversarial read then found the headline verification claim
  ("Fable catches what Opus misses") rested on a grader flaw; re-measured
  fairly, Opus/low 4/4, Fable/low 4/4, Sonnet/low 3/4. The verification lane
  is retracted, Fable 5.1 is escalation-only with an honest cost line (list
  output 2x Opus, measured total 1-2x by task, no quality edge measured), and
  verification and integration pin to Opus/low - the integrator had paid
  2.7x for a tighter summary. Boot cost tracks the model and whether the
  agent takes `tools: *` (3x), not which built-ins it lists. A zero-token
  hook that rewrites unpinned `Agent` calls was built, proven and rejected
  as unnecessary at a 3% miss rate. Block tag `tier-rule v1.10.0`.
- **1.9.0** - Newest-in-tier, and Fable 5.1. The per-version deny list ("never
  Opus 4.6 or Sonnet 4.6") was a special case of a general rule the routing
  table now states once: **within a tier, always the newest model** - same or
  lower price, better model. Verified against the live pricing page: Opus 5,
  4.8, 4.7 and 4.6 are all $5/$25; Sonnet 5's $2/$10 (introductory pricing now
  made permanent) undercuts Sonnet 4.6's $3/$15; Fable 5.1 matches Fable 5's
  $10/$50 with **cache reads at a quarter of the price** and materially higher
  benchmarks. Fable 5.1 is therefore the Fable the rule means. Two practical
  facts ride along: the short alias `fable` still resolves to Fable 5, so pin
  by full model ID where an alias lags (agent frontmatter honors full IDs -
  verified at runtime); and because Fable 5.1's cache reads are half of Opus
  5's, long cache-bound sessions narrow the "2x Opus" gap the escalation rule
  assumes. Block tag `tier-rule v1.9.0`; `/tier` upgrades older installs in place.
- **1.8.1** - `/tier` is now aware of a user-level global rule. The skill only
  ever read PROJECT files, so a user carrying the rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  (which loads automatically in every session) who ran `/tier` in a project got
  a second ~900-token copy loading alongside the global on every turn - the
  skill's own author accumulated six stale project copies this way before
  noticing. New step 0 checks the user-level file first: already covered by a
  same-or-newer global in local mode -> stop and say so; global older than the
  skill -> offer to upgrade the GLOBAL in place (one copy, every project);
  `/tier repo` proceeds regardless, since committed-file coverage for web and
  mobile sessions is its whole point, noting that local sessions in that
  project will then load both copies. Rule content is unchanged - the block tag
  stays `tier-rule v1.8.0` and existing installs are untouched.
- **1.8.0** - The first release since 1.6.0, and the first whose every number
  was measured rather than reasoned about. 1.6.0 was not broken; it was simply
  built on assumptions nobody had tested. Everything in between was unreleased
  development - including several corrections that never reached anyone, which
  is why it collapses into this one entry rather than a run of them. The commit
  log carries that detail.

  **Measured, reproducible on any machine:**
  - Switching model OR effort mid-session drops `cache_read` to zero and costs
    **20x the identical turn** ($0.017 -> $0.346), with a control turn proving
    the cache returns once the setting holds. Both are start-of-session choices.
  - A cache WRITE costs ~20x a cache READ for the same tokens, so a thrashing
    session pays roughly **double list price** - not merely losing a discount.
  - A sub-agent pays a flat BOOT cost before doing any work: **~10K on Haiku,
    ~44K on Opus** (~$0.28). It scales with the MODEL, not the agent's `tools:`
    list - a controlled A/B differed by 0.6%. Small one-shot work is therefore
    cheaper INLINE however cheap the model.
  - An unpinned sub-agent really does inherit the session model - verified, and
    it burned 44,363 tokens to reply "OK".
  - A parallel fan-out shares the prefix the first agent cached: three agents
    dispatched together wrote **17.9K boot tokens against ~29.4K separately**.
  - Delegation overhead is not a constant. WITH a real tier drop it inverts -
    a bounded task cost **0.82x** delegated versus inline.
  - Haiku's effort dial works, with a narrow range: 1.7x low-to-max against
    Sonnet's 9.5x.

  **Also fixed:** the routing table no longer contradicts the boot floor; the
  rule states each condition in one sentence instead of a paragraph of
  evidence; and the README documents that pinning sub-agent effort needs
  `.claude/agents/*.md` files, which `/tier` does not create.

  **If you installed between 14 Aug and now, you had 1.6.0 regardless of what
  this repo said.** The plugin manifests pin a release asset by URL and
  sha256, and they had been left at 1.6.0, so the marketplace served that
  build no matter what landed on `main`. Fixed here, and the verification
  suite now fails if the published release and the pinned version ever
  diverge again.
- **1.6.0** - Butter-smooth install, clean repos. Two changes.
  **(1) One-command installers** for macOS/Linux (`install.sh`) and Windows
  (`install.ps1`) that absorb every blocker observed in the wild: missing
  Claude Code CLI (auto-installs it), `claude` not on PATH (uses the absolute
  path; persists PATH only when the shell profile is actually writable, with
  the `chown` fix printed when it isn't), and SSH-to-GitHub failures (forces
  HTTPS via env vars for the install only - your git config is never
  touched). If the plugin route still fails, the installer falls back to a
  direct no-git skill copy into `~/.claude/skills/`. The plugin itself now
  ships as a **sha256-pinned zip archive** (release asset), and the
  marketplace can be added straight from its manifest URL - so the native
  plugin flow works end-to-end with no git on the machine at all. README
  gains audience-based install paths (beginner one-liners per platform,
  two-command CLI path, git-free native path, desktop GUI, cloud
  `settings.json`) and a troubleshooting section.
  **(2) `/tier` no longer touches your repo by default.** The rule is a
  personal working preference, so it now lands in a machine-local
  `CLAUDE.local.md` kept untracked via `.git/info/exclude` (not even your
  `.gitignore` changes); previously it was written into the committed
  `CLAUDE.md`, pushing one person's preference onto every collaborator.
  `/tier repo` keeps the old behavior as an explicit opt-in for web + mobile
  coverage, and `/tier` offers to migrate pre-1.6 blocks out of committed
  `CLAUDE.md`. Block tag is now `tier-rule v1.6` (heading made
  location-neutral; rule content unchanged) - `/tier` auto-upgrades older
  installs in place.
- **1.5.0** - Corrects 1.4.0's reasoning and hardens the response. 1.4.0
  implied that keeping web content out of the frontier context would avoid
  mid-task model downgrades. **That was wrong** - a downgrade was later
  observed on a routine README edit with no web content involved. 1.5.0
  therefore states plainly that **downgrades are unpredictable and cannot be
  prevented**, keeps the delegate-bulk-content rule but justifies it purely
  as *routing* (it is Sonnet-tier work regardless), and turns the response
  into a numbered protocol ending in the step 1.4.0 missed: **after the model
  is restored, re-verify any quality-critical output produced during the
  downgrade window.** A silent tier loss is only harmless if nothing
  important was decided inside it.
- **1.4.0** - First attempt at guarding mid-task model downgrades: delegate
  web fetches to cheap sub-agents, announce downgrades, pause judgment work.
  Superseded by 1.5.0, whose rationale is correct.
- **1.3.0** - Anti-drift rules, learned from a long session where the routing
  silently decayed. Three additions: **pin every sub-agent** (an unpinned
  agent inherits the session model, so mechanical fan-out silently runs at
  frontier prices with no visible signal); a **capacity-error repair rule**
  (a rate-limited tier means retry that agent elsewhere, never strip pins
  globally - and restore them immediately if you do); and **state the routing
  before spending it** (any 3+ agent fan-out announces "6 x Sonnet/medium"
  first, so a mis-route is caught before the tokens, not after). Block tag is
  now `tier-rule v1.3`; `/tier` auto-upgrades older installs in place.
- **1.2.1** - `/tier` now handles non-repo directories (home folder, scratch
  space, unversioned code): it installs into the current directory's
  `CLAUDE.md` as a machine-local rule instead of skipping. Installed block
  unchanged (still `tier-rule v1.2`) - existing installs need nothing.
- **1.2.0** - Subscription-aware (plans without Fable treat Opus as the top
  tier automatically); Fable escalation triggers now cover its benchmarked
  strengths (high-stakes deep research, long-horizon software engineering,
  legal/compliance-critical and deep security analysis); canonical block
  rewritten model-first (compact, imperative, cheaper per session); versioned
  upgrade tag (`tier-rule v1.2`) so `/tier` upgrades reliably across future
  releases.
- **1.1.0** - Opus 5 era routing. Opus is now the default top tier (including
  reviews, synthesis, and final judgment); Fable becomes an explicit
  escalation with named triggers. New "routing is free" principle. `/tier`
  now auto-upgrades older installed blocks in place.
- **1.0.0** - Initial release.
