# tier - model & effort tiering for Claude Code

A tiny, opinionated Claude Code skill: run **`/tier`** in any project and it
installs a standing *model/effort-tiering* working preference into that
project's `CLAUDE.md`. From then on, that project runs **quality-first and
cost-efficient** - automatically, on desktop, web, and mobile.

Simple on purpose. It doesn't hook, poll, or call anything - it writes one
clear rule into the file Claude Code always reads, and gets out of the way.

## What the rule does

- **Plan on the highest model available**; every plan assigns a model tier
  **and** an effort level (low to max) per work item.
- **Routes work to the right tier:** deterministic batteries (tests, builds,
  linters) run with no model at all; mechanical gathering to Sonnet;
  substantive builds, verifiers, correctness/security reviews, and final
  judgment to Opus - since Opus 5, Opus is the default top tier.
- **Fable is an escalation, not a default:** roughly 2x Opus cost and heavier
  token use for an overall lead that is now marginal (Opus 5 wins several
  areas outright). The rule reserves Fable for the longest, hardest
  frontier-reasoning work, tie-break adjudication after strong models
  disagree, or an explicit request.
- **Routing is free:** the rule is a lookup table, not a deliberation. The
  routing decision must never cost more tokens than it can save - small tasks
  skip routing entirely and just run on the current model.
- **Per-task fit:** *downgrade* to a cheaper model directly when the work is
  clearly mechanical; *upgrade* only after asking you first.
- **Hard rule that overrides everything: never compromise quality.** Any doubt
  whether a downgrade would hurt = don't downgrade.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add thephenyl02-creator/claude-tier
/plugin install tier@claude-tier
```

Then, in any project:

```
/tier
```

It adds the rule to that project's `CLAUDE.md` (creating it if needed). If the
project already carries an **older version** of the rule, `/tier` upgrades the
block in place automatically; if it's already current, it skips. Either way it
offers to commit `CLAUDE.md` so web + mobile sessions pick it up too.

## Why "simple is best"

Other routers auto-switch your model via hooks, or ship complex config
profiles. This one is deliberately minimal: one command, one durable rule, no
moving parts to break. You stay in control of the actual model; the rule just
keeps every session honest about tiering - and never trades quality for cost.

## Release notes

- **1.1.0** - Opus 5 era routing. Opus is now the default top tier (including
  reviews, synthesis, and final judgment); Fable becomes an explicit
  escalation with named triggers. New "routing is free" principle. `/tier`
  now auto-upgrades older installed blocks in place.
- **1.0.0** - Initial release.
